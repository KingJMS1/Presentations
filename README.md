## Presentations
Presentations given by me at various conferences/events. 

### Presentations
* ASA Florida Chapter Meeting 2024 
  * Bayesian GEV regression model with gaussian process distributed spatial random effects, applied to yearly Florida storm surge data, Purpose: Risk analysis
  * https://github.com/KingJMS1/Presentations/blob/main/Presentations/Bayesian_Florida_Storm_Surge_Model__MDPI_-2.pdf
* Doctoral Candidacy Proposal (2024)
  * Demonstrates some proposed changes to the model from https://www.doi.org/10.3390/math13030486 to make the effects of changes to some parameters more stable, proposes a general 
    Bayesian Hierarchical modeling framework for models dealing with spatiotemporal positions, Purpose: Recover uncertainties in model parameters and random effects for Risk analysis
